# MeshModifiers
An easy-to-use mesh-modifying system that functions similarly to 3D modeling programs, in realtime.

**FEATURES**

- Modifiers are stackable

- You can save modified meshes to your project

- Calculations can be split over multiple frames/updates in user-defined or auto-calculated chunks for increased performance

- Use your favorite vertex painter to paint how much a vertex can be affected by modifiers.

- Very easy to extend

- Component-based

- Calculations don't run unless you want them to

- You can control when internal data is calculated, as well as when the mesh updates; from the inspector or control even more through your own code

- Fully commented ( so that if the code is bad, you know why! )

(Current) **LIMITATIONS**

- Runs on CPU / Is not multi-threaded (yet?)

- Only runs in Play Mode/Runtime
